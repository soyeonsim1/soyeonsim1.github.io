# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Hello. I am a PhD student in the Department of Applied Linguistics and ESL at Georgia State University. My research interests include second language acquisition, technology-enhanced language learning, learner corpora, pragmatics, and usage-based linguistics. I am interested in how new forms of technology can facilitate language learning in autonomous learning contexts as well as classroom settings. I am also interested in gaining insights into L2 learners’ developmental trajectories from learner corpora.
